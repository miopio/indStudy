31708306 Three-dimensional documentation of the axonal pathways connecting gray matter components of the human brain has wide-ranging scientific and clinical applications. Recent attempts to map human structural connectomes have concentrated on using tractography results derived from diffusion-weighted imaging data, but tractography is an indirect method with numerous limitations. Advances in holographic visualization platforms provide a new medium to integrate anatomical data, as well as a novel working environment for collaborative interaction between neuroanatomists and brain-imaging scientists. Therefore, we developed the first holographic interface for building axonal pathways, populated it with human histological and structural MRI data, and assembled world expert neuroanatomists to interactively define axonal trajectories of the cortical, basal ganglia, and cerebellar systems. This blending of advanced visualization hardware, software development, and neuroanatomy data enabled the translation of decades of amassed knowledge into a human axonal pathway atlas that can be applied to educational, scientific, or clinical investigations. 2019 Holographic Reconstruction of Axonal Pathways in the Human Brain.

31706697 The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) performs many functions, including decision making and movement control. It remains unknown which input and output pathways of PPC support different functions. We addressed this issue in mice, focusing on PPC neurons projecting to the dorsal striatum (PPC-STR) and the posterior secondary motor cortex (PPC-pM2). Projection-specific, retrograde labeling showed that PPC-STR and PPC-pM2 represent largely distinct subpopulations, with PPC-STR receiving stronger inputs from association areas and PPC-pM2 receiving stronger sensorimotor inputs. Two-photon calcium imaging during decision making revealed that the PPC-STR population encodes history-dependent choice bias more strongly than PPC-pM2 or general PPC populations. Furthermore, optogenetic inactivation of PPC-STR neurons or their terminals in STR decreased history-dependent bias, while inactivation of PPC-pM2 neurons altered movement kinematics. Therefore, PPC biases action selection through its STR projection while controlling movements through PPC-pM2 neurons. PPC may support multiple functions through parallel subpopulations, each with distinct input-output connectivity. 2019 Corticostriatal Flow of Action Selection Bias. Neuron United States
31706696 The olfactory bulbs (OBs) are the first site of odor representation in the mammalian brain, and their unique ultrastructure is considered a necessary substrate for spatiotemporal coding of smell. Given this, we were struck by the serendipitous observation at MRI of two otherwise healthy young left-handed women, yet with no apparent OBs. Standardized tests revealed normal odor awareness, detection, discrimination, identification, and representation. Functional MRI of these women's brains revealed that odorant-induced activity in piriform cortex, the primary OB target, was similar in its extent to that of intact controls. Finally, review of a public brain-MRI database with 1,113 participants (606 women) also tested for olfactory performance, uncovered olfaction without anatomically defined OBs in ∼0.6% of women and ∼4.25% of left-handed women. Thus, humans can perform the basic facets of olfaction without canonical OBs, implying extreme plasticity in the functional neuroanatomy of this sensory system. 2019 Human Olfaction without Apparent Olfactory Bulbs.

31704028 Fine orchestration of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic development is required for normal brain function, and alterations may cause neurodevelopmental disorders. Using sparse molecular manipulations in intact brain circuits, we show that the glutamate receptor delta-1 (GluD1), a member of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), is a postsynaptic organizer of inhibitory synapses in cortical pyramidal neurons. GluD1 is selectively required for the formation of inhibitory synapses and regulates GABAergic synaptic transmission accordingly. At inhibitory synapses, GluD1 interacts with cerebellin-4, an extracellular scaffolding protein secreted by somatostatin-expressing interneurons, which bridges postsynaptic GluD1 and presynaptic neurexins. When binding to its agonist glycine or D-serine, GluD1 elicits non-ionotropic postsynaptic signaling involving the guanine nucleotide exchange factor ARHGEF12 and the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 PPP1R12A. Thus, GluD1 defines a trans-synaptic interaction regulating postsynaptic signaling pathways for the proper establishment of cortical inhibitory connectivity and challenges the dichotomy between iGluRs and inhibitory synaptic molecules. 2019 Trans-Synaptic Signaling through the Glutamate Receptor Delta-1 Mediates Inhibitory Synapse Formation in Cortical Pyramidal Neurons.

31697921 One of the most common brain tumors in children and adults is glioma or astrocytoma. There are few effective therapies for these cancers, and patients with malignant glioma fare poorly, even after aggressive surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Over the past decade, it is now appreciated that these tumors are composed of numerous distinct neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell populations, which could each influence overall tumor biology and response to therapy. Among these noncancerous cell types, monocytes (microglia and macrophages) predominate. In this Review, we discuss the complex interactions involving microglia and macrophages relevant to glioma formation, progression, and response to therapy. 2019 Microglia/Brain Macrophages as Central Drivers of Brain Tumor Pathobiology.

31679900 Secretion principles are conserved from yeast to humans, and many yeast orthologs have established roles in synaptic vesicle exocytosis in the mammalian brain. Surprisingly, SEC4 orthologs and their effectors, the exocyst, are dispensable for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Here, we identify the SEC4 ortholog RAB3 and its neuronal effector, RIM1, as essential molecules for neuropeptide and neurotrophin release from dense-core vesicles (DCVs) in mammalian neurons. Inactivation of all four RAB3 genes nearly ablated DCV exocytosis, and re-expression of RAB3A restored this deficit. In RIM1/2-deficient neurons, DCV exocytosis was undetectable. Full-length RIM1, but not mutants that lack RAB3 or MUNC13 binding, restored release. Strikingly, a short N-terminal RIM1 fragment only harboring RAB3- and MUNC13-interacting domains was sufficient to support DCV exocytosis. We propose that RIM and MUNC13 emerged as mammalian alternatives to the yeast exocyst complex as essential RAB3/SEC4 effectors and organizers of DCV fusion sites by recruiting DCVs via RAB3. 2019 The RAB3-RIM Pathway Is Essential for the Release of Neuromodulators.

31677957 Spatial learning requires remembering and choosing paths to goals. Hippocampal place cells replay spatial paths during immobility in reverse and forward order, offering a potential mechanism. However, how replay supports both goal-directed learning and memory-guided decision making is unclear. We therefore continuously tracked awake replay in the same hippocampal-prefrontal ensembles throughout learning of a spatial alternation task. We found that, during pauses between behavioral trajectories, reverse and forward hippocampal replay supports an internal cognitive search of available past and future possibilities and exhibits opposing learning gradients for prediction of past and future behavioral paths, respectively. Coordinated hippocampal-prefrontal replay distinguished correct past and future paths from alternative choices, suggesting a role in recall of past paths to guide planning of future decisions for spatial working memory. Our findings reveal a learning shift from hippocampal reverse-replay-based retrospective evaluation to forward-replay-based prospective planning, with prefrontal readout of memory-guided paths for learning and decision making. 2019 Dynamics of Awake Hippocampal-Prefrontal Replay for Spatial Learning and Memory-Guided Decision Making.

31676170 Social environment modulates learning through unknown mechanisms. Here, we report that a pheromone mixture that signals overcrowding inhibits C. elegans from learning to avoid pathogenic bacteria. We find that learning depends on the balanced signaling of two insulin-like peptides (ILPs), INS-16 and INS-4, which act respectively in the pheromone-sensing neuron ADL and the bacteria-sensing neuron AWA. Pheromone exposure inhibits learning by disrupting this balance: it activates ADL and increases expression of ins-16, and this cellular effect reduces AWA activity and AWA-expressed ins-4. The activities of the sensory neurons are required for learning and the expression of the ILPs. Interestingly, pheromones also promote the ingestion of pathogenic bacteria while increasing resistance to the pathogen. Thus, the balance of the ILP signals integrates social information into the learning process as part of a coordinated adaptive response that allows consumption of harmful food during times of high population density. 2019 Pheromones Modulate Learning by Regulating the Balanced Signals of Two Insulin-like Peptides.

31672263 Chronic stress (CS) is a major risk factor for the development of depression. Here, we demonstrate that CS-induced hyperactivity in ventral tegmental area (VTA)-projecting lateral habenula (LHb) neurons is associated with increased passive coping (PC), but not anxiety or anhedonia. LHb→VTA neurons in mice with increased PC show increased burst and tonic firing as well as synaptic adaptations in excitatory inputs from the entopeduncular nucleus (EP). In vivo manipulations of EP→LHb or LHb→VTA neurons selectively alter PC and effort-related motivation. Conversely, dorsal raphe (DR)-projecting LHb neurons do not show CS-induced hyperactivity and are targeted indirectly by the EP. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we reveal a set of genes that can collectively serve as biomarkers to identify mice with increased PC and differentiate LHb→VTA from LHb→DR neurons. Together, we provide a set of biological markers at the level of genes, synapses, cells, and circuits that define a distinctive CS-induced behavioral phenotype. 2019 Chronic Stress Induces Activity, Synaptic, and Transcriptional Remodeling of the Lateral Habenula Associated with Deficits in Motivated Behaviors.

31668844 Manual dexterity requires proprioceptive feedback about the state of the hand. To date, study of the neural basis of proprioception in the cortex has focused primarily on reaching movements to the exclusion of hand-specific behaviors such as grasping. To fill this gap, we record both time-varying hand kinematics and neural activity evoked in somatosensory and motor cortices as monkeys grasp a variety of objects. We find that neurons in the somatosensory cortex, as well as in the motor cortex, preferentially track time-varying postures of multi-joint combinations spanning the entire hand. This contrasts with neural responses during reaching movements, which preferentially track time-varying movement kinematics of the arm, such as velocity and speed of the limb, rather than its time-varying postural configuration. These results suggest different representations of arm and hand movements suited to the different functional roles of these two effectors. 2019 Postural Representations of the Hand in the Primate Sensorimotor Cortex.

31668485 Top-down modulation of visual processing is mediated in part by direct prefrontal to visual cortical projections. Here, we show that the mouse cingulate cortex (Cg) regulates visual processing not only through corticocortical neurons projecting to the visual cortex but also through corticotectal neurons projecting subcortically. Bidirectional optogenetic manipulation demonstrated a prominent contribution of Cg corticotectal neurons to visually guided behavior, which is mediated by their collateral projections to both the motor-related layers of the superior colliculus (SC) and the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus (LP, analogous to the primate pulvinar). Whereas the Cg innervates the anterior LP (LPa), the SC innervates the posterior LP (LPp). Activating each stage of the Cg→SC→LPp or the Cg→LPa pathway strongly enhanced visual performance of the mouse and the sensory responses of visual cortical neurons. These results delineate two subcortical pathways by which a subtype of prefrontal pyramidal neurons exerts a powerful top-down influence on visual processing. 2019 Prefrontal Corticotectal Neurons Enhance Visual Processing through the Superior Colliculus and Pulvinar Thalamus.

31668484 Anatomical and behavioral data suggest that the ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex (VLO), which exhibits extensive connectivity and supports diverse sensory and cognitive processes, may exert global influence over brain activity. However, this hypothesis has never been tested directly. We applied optogenetic fMRI to drive various elements of VLO circuitry while visualizing the whole-brain response. Surprisingly, driving excitatory thalamocortical projections to VLO at low frequencies (5-10 Hz) evoked widespread, bilateral decreases in brain activity spanning multiple cortical and subcortical structures. This pattern was unique to thalamocortical projections, with direct stimulations of neither VLO nor thalamus eliciting such a response. High-frequency stimulations (25-40 Hz) of thalamocortical projections evoked dramatically different-though still far-reaching-responses, in the form of widespread ipsilateral activation. Importantly, decreases in brain activity evoked by low-frequency thalamocortical input were mediated by GABA and activity in zona incerta. These findings identify specific circuit mechanisms underlying VLO control of brain-wide neural activities. 2019 Thalamic Input to Orbitofrontal Cortex Drives Brain-wide, Frequency-Dependent Inhibition Mediated by GABA and Zona Incerta.

31653463 Cognitive activity emerges from large-scale neuronal dynamics that are constrained to a low-dimensional manifold. How this low-dimensional manifold scales with cognitive complexity, and which brain regions regulate this process, are not well understood. We addressed this issue by analyzing sub-second high-field fMRI data acquired during performance of a task that systematically varied the complexity of cognitive reasoning. We show that task performance reconfigures the low-dimensional manifold and that deviations from these patterns relate to performance errors. We further demonstrate that individual differences in thalamic activity relate to reconfigurations of the low-dimensional architecture during task engagement. 2019 The Low-Dimensional Neural Architecture of Cognitive Complexity Is Related to Activity in Medial Thalamic Nuclei.

31648900 Humans can easily focus on one speaker in a multi-talker acoustic environment, but how different areas of the human auditory cortex (AC) represent the acoustic components of mixed speech is unknown. We obtained invasive recordings from the primary and nonprimary AC in neurosurgical patients as they listened to multi-talker speech. We found that neural sites in the primary AC responded to individual speakers in the mixture and were relatively unchanged by attention. In contrast, neural sites in the nonprimary AC were less discerning of individual speakers but selectively represented the attended speaker. Moreover, the encoding of the attended speaker in the nonprimary AC was invariant to the degree of acoustic overlap with the unattended speaker. Finally, this emergent representation of attended speech in the nonprimary AC was linearly predictable from the primary AC responses. Our results reveal the neural computations underlying the hierarchical formation of auditory objects in human AC during multi-talker speech perception. 2019 Hierarchical Encoding of Attended Auditory Objects in Multi-talker Speech Perception.

31648899 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with noise hypersensitivity, the suboptimal extraction of meaningful signals in noisy environments. Because sensory filtering can involve distinct automatic and executive circuit mechanisms, however, developing circuit-specific therapeutic strategies for ASD noise hypersensitivity can be challenging. Here, we find that both of these processes are individually perturbed in one monogenic form of ASD, Ptchd1 deletion. Although Ptchd1 is preferentially expressed in the thalamic reticular nucleus during development, pharmacological rescue of thalamic perturbations in knockout (KO) mice only normalized automatic sensory filtering. By discovering a separate prefrontal perturbation in these animals and adopting a combinatorial pharmacological approach that also rescued its associated goal-directed noise filtering deficit, we achieved full normalization of noise hypersensitivity in this model. Overall, our work highlights the importance of identifying large-scale functional circuit architectures and utilizing them as access points for behavioral disease correction. 2019 Combinatorial Targeting of Distributed Forebrain Networks Reverses Noise Hypersensitivity in a Model of Autism Spectrum Disorder.

31648898 Age-related neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by a slow, persistent accumulation of aggregated proteins. Although cells can elicit physiological responses to enhance cellular clearance and counteract accumulation, it is unclear how pathogenic proteins evade this process in disease. We find that Parkinson's disease α-synuclein perturbs the physiological response to lysosomal stress by impeding the SNARE protein ykt6. Cytosolic ykt6 is normally autoinhibited by a unique farnesyl-mediated regulatory mechanism; however, during lysosomal stress, it activates and redistributes into membranes to preferentially promote hydrolase trafficking and enhance cellular clearance. α-Synuclein aberrantly binds and deactivates ykt6 in patient-derived neurons, thereby disabling the lysosomal stress response and facilitating protein accumulation. Activating ykt6 by small-molecule farnesyltransferase inhibitors restores lysosomal activity and reduces α-synuclein in patient-derived neurons and mice. Our findings indicate that α-synuclein creates a permissive environment for aggregate persistence by inhibiting regulated cellular clearance and provide a therapeutic strategy to restore protein homeostasis by harnessing SNARE activity. 2019 Stress-Induced Cellular Clearance Is Mediated by the SNARE Protein ykt6 and Disrupted by α-Synuclein.

31647894 The mammalian visual system encodes information over a remarkable breadth of spatiotemporal scales and light intensities. This performance originates with its complement of photoreceptors: the classic rods and cones, as well as the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). IpRGCs capture light with a G-protein-coupled receptor called melanopsin, depolarize like photoreceptors of invertebrates such as Drosophila, discharge electrical spikes, and innervate dozens of brain areas to influence physiology, behavior, perception, and mood. Several visual responses rely on melanopsin to be sustained and maximal. Some require ipRGCs to occur at all. IpRGCs fulfill their roles using mechanisms that include an unusual conformation of the melanopsin protein, an extraordinarily slow phototransduction cascade, divisions of labor even among cells of a morphological type, and unorthodox configurations of circuitry. The study of ipRGCs has yielded insight into general topics that include photoreceptor evolution, cellular diversity, and the steps from biophysical mechanisms to behavior. 2019 Melanopsin and the Intrinsically Photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells: Biophysics to Behavior.

31630908 Rapid conduction of nerve impulses is critical in life and relies on action potential (AP) leaps through the nodes of Ranvier (NRs) along myelinated nerves. While NRs are the only sites where APs can be regenerated during nerve conduction on myelinated nerves, ion channel mechanisms underlying the regeneration and conduction of APs at mammalian NRs remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that TREK-1 and TRAAK, the thermosensitive and mechanosensitive two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) channels, are clustered at NRs of rat trigeminal Aβ-afferent nerves with a density over 3,000-fold higher than that on their somas. These K2P channels, but not voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels as in other parts of nerves, are required for rapid AP repolarization at the NRs. Furthermore, these channels permit high-speed and high-frequency AP conduction along the myelinated afferent nerves, and loss of function of these channels at NRs retards nerve conduction and impairs sensory behavioral responses in animals. 2019 TREK-1 and TRAAK Are Principal K<sup>+</sup> Channels at the Nodes of Ranvier for Rapid Action Potential Conduction on Mammalian Myelinated Afferent Nerves.

31627985 Persistence of reward seeking despite punishment or other negative consequences is a defining feature of mania and addiction, and numerous brain regions have been implicated in such punishment learning, but in disparate ways that are difficult to reconcile. We now show that the ability of an aversive punisher to inhibit reward seeking depends on coordinated activity of three distinct afferents to the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) arising from cortex, brainstem, and habenula that drive triply dissociable RMTg responses to aversive cues, outcomes, and prediction errors, respectively. These three pathways drive correspondingly dissociable aspects of punishment learning. The RMTg in turn drives negative, but not positive, valence encoding patterns in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Hence, punishment learning involves pathways and functions that are highly distinct, yet tightly coordinated. 2019 Three Rostromedial Tegmental Afferents Drive Triply Dissociable Aspects of Punishment Learning and Aversive Valence Encoding.

31623919 Neurodegenerative diseases appear to progress by spreading via brain connections. Here we evaluated this transneuronal degeneration hypothesis by attempting to predict future atrophy in a longitudinal cohort of patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). We determined patient-specific &quot;epicenters&quot; at baseline, located each patient's epicenters in the healthy functional connectome, and derived two region-wise graph theoretical metrics to predict future atrophy: (1) shortest path length to the epicenter and (2) nodal hazard, the cumulative atrophy of a region's first-degree neighbors. Using these predictors and baseline atrophy, we could accurately predict longitudinal atrophy in most patients. The regions most vulnerable to subsequent atrophy were functionally connected to the epicenter and had intermediate levels of baseline atrophy. These findings provide novel, longitudinal evidence that neurodegeneration progresses along connectional pathways and, further developed, could lead to network-based clinical tools for prognostication and disease monitoring. 2019 Patient-Tailored, Connectivity-Based Forecasts of Spreading Brain Atrophy.

31623918 Whether mouse visual cortex contains orderly feature maps is debated. The overlapping pattern of geniculocortical inputs with M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-rich patches in layer 1 (L1) suggests a non-random architecture. Here, we found that L1 inputs from the lateral posterior thalamus (LP) avoid patches and target interpatches. Channelrhodopsin-2-assisted mapping of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in L2/3 shows that the relative excitation of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVs) and pyramidal neurons (PNs) by dLGN, LP, and cortical feedback is distinct and depends on whether the neurons reside in clusters aligned with patches or interpatches. Paired recordings from PVs and PNs show that unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) are larger in interpatches than in patches. The spatial clustering of inhibition is matched by dense clustering of PV terminals in interpatches. The results show that the excitation/inhibition balance across V1 is organized into patch and interpatch subnetworks, which receive distinct long-range inputs and are specialized for the processing of distinct spatiotemporal features. 2019 Spatial Clustering of Inhibition in Mouse Primary Visual Cortex.

31607423 Perceptual decisions are often based on multiple sensory inputs whose reliabilities rapidly vary over time, yet little is known about how the brain integrates these inputs to optimize behavior. The optimal solution requires that neurons simply add their sensory inputs across time and modalities, as long as these inputs are encoded with an invariant linear probabilistic population code (ilPPC). While this theoretical possibility has been raised before, it has never been tested experimentally. Here, we report that neural activities in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of macaques performing a vestibular-visual multisensory decision-making task are indeed consistent with the ilPPC theory. More specifically, we found that LIP accumulates momentary evidence proportional to the visual speed and the absolute value of vestibular acceleration, two variables that are encoded with close approximations to ilPPCs in sensory areas. Together, these results provide a remarkably simple and biologically plausible solution to near-optimal multisensory decision making. 2019 Neural Correlates of Optimal Multisensory Decision Making under Time-Varying Reliabilities with an Invariant Linear Probabilistic Population Code.

31606248 Localized protein synthesis is fundamental for neuronal development, maintenance, and function. Transcriptomes in axons and soma are distinct, but the mechanisms governing the composition of axonal transcriptomes and their developmental regulation are only partially understood. We found that the binding motif for the RNA-binding proteins Pumilio 1 and 2 (Pum1 and Pum2) is underrepresented in transcriptomes of developing axons. Introduction of Pumilio-binding elements (PBEs) into mRNAs containing a β-actin zipcode prevented axonal localization and translation. Pum2 is restricted to the soma of developing neurons, and Pum2 knockdown or blocking its binding to mRNA caused the appearance and translation of PBE-containing mRNAs in axons. Pum2-deficient neurons exhibited axonal growth and branching defects in vivo and impaired axon regeneration in vitro. These results reveal that Pum2 shapes axonal transcriptomes by preventing the transport of PBE-containing mRNAs into axons, and they identify somatic mRNAs retention as a mechanism for the temporal control of intra-axonal protein synthesis. 2019 Pum2 Shapes the Transcriptome in Developing Axons through Retention of Target mRNAs in the Cell Body.

31606247 SETD1A, a lysine-methyltransferase, is a key schizophrenia susceptibility gene. Mice carrying a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation of the orthologous gene exhibit alterations in axonal branching and cortical synaptic dynamics accompanied by working memory deficits. We show that Setd1a binds both promoters and enhancers with a striking overlap between Setd1a and Mef2 on enhancers. Setd1a targets are highly expressed in pyramidal neurons and display a complex pattern of transcriptional up- and downregulations shaped by presumed opposing functions of Setd1a on promoters and Mef2-bound enhancers. Notably, evolutionarily conserved Setd1a targets are associated with neuropsychiatric genetic risk burden. Reinstating Setd1a expression in adulthood rescues cognitive deficits. Finally, we identify LSD1 as a major counteracting demethylase for Setd1a and show that its pharmacological antagonism results in a full rescue of the behavioral and morphological deficits in Setd1a-deficient mice. Our findings advance understanding of how SETD1A mutations predispose to schizophrenia (SCZ) and point to novel therapeutic interventions. 2019 Recapitulation and Reversal of Schizophrenia-Related Phenotypes in Setd1a-Deficient Mice.

31604597 Excitatory neurotransmission and its activity-dependent plasticity are largely determined by AMPA-receptors (AMPARs), ion channel complexes whose cell physiology is encoded by their interactome. Here, we delineate the assembly of AMPARs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of native neurons as multi-state production line controlled by distinct interactome constituents: ABHD6 together with porcupine stabilizes pore-forming GluA monomers, and the intellectual-disability-related FRRS1l-CPT1c complexes promote GluA oligomerization and co-assembly of GluA tetramers with cornichon and transmembrane AMPA-regulatory proteins (TARP) to render receptor channels ready for ER exit. Disruption of the assembly line by FRRS1l deletion largely reduces AMPARs in the plasma membrane, impairs synapse formation, and abolishes activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, while FRRS1l overexpression has the opposite effect. As a consequence, FRSS1l knockout mice display severe deficits in learning tasks and behavior. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the stepwise biogenesis of AMPARs in native ER membranes and establish FRRS1l as a powerful regulator of synaptic signaling and plasticity. 2019 An ER Assembly Line of AMPA-Receptors Controls Excitatory Neurotransmission and Its Plasticity.

31601510 Homeostatic mechanisms stabilize neuronal activity in vivo, but whether this process gives rise to balanced network dynamics is unknown. Here, we continuously monitored the statistics of network spiking in visual cortical circuits in freely behaving rats for 9 days. Under control conditions in light and dark, networks were robustly organized around criticality, a regime that maximizes information capacity and transmission. When input was perturbed by visual deprivation, network criticality was severely disrupted and subsequently restored to criticality over 48 h. Unexpectedly, the recovery of excitatory dynamics preceded homeostatic plasticity of firing rates by &gt;30 h. We utilized model investigations to manipulate firing rate homeostasis in a cell-type-specific manner at the onset of visual deprivation. Our results suggest that criticality in excitatory networks is established by inhibitory plasticity and architecture. These data establish that criticality is consistent with a homeostatic set point for visual cortical dynamics and suggest a key role for homeostatic regulation of inhibition. 2019 Cortical Circuit Dynamics Are Homeostatically Tuned to Criticality In Vivo.

31600518 Vocal learning is a behavioral trait in which the social and acoustic environment shapes the vocal repertoire of individuals. Over the past century, the study of vocal learning has progressed at the intersection of ecology, physiology, neuroscience, molecular biology, genomics, and evolution. Yet, despite the complexity of this trait, vocal learning is frequently described as a binary trait, with species being classified as either vocal learners or vocal non-learners. As a result, studies have largely focused on a handful of species for which strong evidence for vocal learning exists. Recent studies, however, suggest a continuum in vocal learning capacity across taxa. Here, we further suggest that vocal learning is a multi-component behavioral phenotype comprised of distinct yet interconnected modules. Discretizing the vocal learning phenotype into its constituent modules would facilitate integration of findings across a wider diversity of species, taking advantage of the ways in which each excels in a particular module, or in a specific combination of features. Such comparative studies can improve understanding of the mechanisms and evolutionary origins of vocal learning. We propose an initial set of vocal learning modules supported by behavioral and neurobiological data and highlight the need for diversifying the field in order to disentangle the complexity of the vocal learning phenotype. 2019 A Modular Approach to Vocal Learning: Disentangling the Diversity of a Complex Behavioral Trait.

31600517 Observational fear learning in rodents is a type of context-dependent fear conditioning in which an unconditioned stimulus (US) is provided vicariously by observing conspecific others receiving foot shocks. This suggests the involvement of affective empathy, with several recent studies showing many similarities between this behavior and human empathy. Neurobiologically, it is important to understand the neural mechanisms by which the vicarious US activates the fear circuit via the affective pain system, obviating the sensory pain pathway and eventually leading to fear memory formation. This paper reviews current studies on the neural mechanisms underlying observational fear learning and provides a perspective on future research on this subject. 2019 Neural Basis of Observational Fear Learning: A Potential Model of Affective Empathy.

31600516 Animals infer when and where a reward is available from experience with informative sensory stimuli and their own actions. In vertebrates, this is thought to depend upon the release of dopamine from midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Studies of the role of dopamine have focused almost exclusively on their encoding of informative sensory stimuli; however, many dopaminergic neurons are active just prior to movement initiation, even in the absence of sensory stimuli. How should current frameworks for understanding the role of dopamine incorporate these observations? To address this question, we review recent anatomical and functional evidence for action-related dopamine signaling. We conclude by proposing a framework in which dopaminergic neurons encode subjective signals of action initiation to solve an internal credit assignment problem. 2019 Learning from Action: Reconsidering Movement Signaling in Midbrain Dopamine Neuron Activity.

31600515 The ability to establish behaviorally what psychological capacity an animal is deploying-to discern accurately what an animal is doing-is key to functional analyses of the brain. Our current understanding of these capacities suggests, however, that this task is complex; there is evidence that multiple capacities are engaged simultaneously and contribute independently to the control of behavior. As such, establishing the contribution of a cell, circuit, or neural system to any one function requires careful dissection of that role from its influence on other functions and, therefore, the careful selection and design of behavioral tasks fit for that purpose. Here I describe recent research that has sought to utilize behavioral tools to investigate the neural bases of instrumental conditioning, particularly the circuits and systems supporting the capacity for goal-directed action, as opposed to conditioned reflexes and habits, and how these sources of action control interact to generate adaptive behavior. 2019 The Meaning of Behavior: Discriminating Reflex and Volition in the Brain.

31600514 A critical step toward understanding cognition, learning, and brain dysfunction will be identification of the underlying cellular computations that occur in and across discrete brain areas, as well as how they are progressively altered by experience or disease. These computations will be revealed by targeted analyses of the neurons that perform these calculations, defined not only by their firing properties but also by their molecular identity and how they are wired within the local and broad-scale network of the brain. New studies that take advantage of sophisticated genetic tools for cell-type-specific identification and control are revealing how learning and neurological disorders initiate and successively change the properties of defined neural circuits. Understanding the temporal sequence of adaptive or pathological synaptic changes across multiple synapses within a network will shed light into how small-scale neural circuits contribute to higher cognitive functions during learning and disease. 2019 Progressive Circuit Changes during Learning and Disease.

31600513 Neuroscience needs behavior. However, it is daunting to render the behavior of organisms intelligible without suppressing most, if not all, references to life. When animals are treated as passive stimulus-response, disembodied and identical machines, the life of behavior perishes. Here, we distill three biological principles (materiality, agency, and historicity), spell out their consequences for the study of animal behavior, and illustrate them with various examples from the literature. We propose to put behavior back into context, with the brain in a species-typical body and with the animal's body situated in the world; stamp Newtonian time with nested ontogenetic and phylogenetic processes that give rise to individuals with their own histories; and supplement linear cause-and-effect chains and information processing with circular loops of purpose and meaning. We believe that conceiving behavior in these ways is imperative for neuroscience. 2019 The Life of Behavior. Neuron United States
31600512 To understand decision-making behavior in simple, controlled environments, Bayesian models are often useful. First, optimal behavior is always Bayesian. Second, even when behavior deviates from optimality, the Bayesian approach offers candidate models to account for suboptimalities. Third, a realist interpretation of Bayesian models opens the door to studying the neural representation of uncertainty. In this tutorial, we review the principles of Bayesian models of decision making and then focus on five case studies with exercises. We conclude with reflections and future directions. 2019 Bayesian Decision Models: A Primer. Neuron United States
31600511 The possibility of leveraging video games for enhancing behavior and brain function has led to an emerging new field situated at the crossroads of cognitive neuroscience, health science, educational interventions, and game design. Here we review the impact of video game play, in particular action video game play, on attentional control. We also examine the underlying neural bases of these effects and the game design features hypothesized to drive the plastic changes. We argue that not all games have the same impact, with both differences in the characteristics of the games themselves as well as individual differences in player style determining the final outcome. These facts, mixed with changes in the game industry, (e.g., greater mixing of genre characteristics; greater freedom of player experience) calls for a paradigm shift relative to the approach taken in the field to-date, including iteratively alternating between targeted game design and efficacy evaluation. 2019 Enhancing Attentional Control: Lessons from Action Video Games.

31600510 Memories are about the past, but they serve the future. Memory research often emphasizes the former aspect: focusing on the functions that re-constitute (re-member) experience and elucidating the various types of memories and their interrelations, timescales, and neural bases. Here we highlight the prospective nature of memory in guiding selective attention, focusing on functions that use previous experience to anticipate the relevant events about to unfold-to &quot;premember&quot; experience. Memories of various types and timescales play a fundamental role in guiding perception and performance adaptively, proactively, and dynamically. Consonant with this perspective, memories are often recorded according to expected future demands. Using working memory as an example, we consider how mnemonic content is selected and represented for future use. This perspective moves away from the traditional representational account of memory toward a functional account in which forward-looking memory traces are informationally and computationally tuned for interacting with incoming sensory signals to guide adaptive behavior. 2019 Premembering Experience: A Hierarchy of Time-Scales for Proactive Attention.

31600509 The brain faces various computational tradeoffs, such as the stability-flexibility dilemma. The major ascending neuromodulatory systems are well suited to dynamically regulate these tradeoffs depending on changing task demands. This follows from various general principles of chemical neuromodulation, which are illustrated with evidence from pharmacological neuroimaging studies on striatal dopamine's role in output gating and cost-benefit choice of cognitive tasks. The work raises open questions, including those regarding the top-down cortical control of the midbrain dopamine system, and begins to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the variability in catecholaminergic drug effects. Such drug effects depend on the baseline state of distinct target brain regions, reflecting, in part, the systems' self-regulatory capacity to maintain equilibrium. It is hypothesized that the basal tone of different dopaminergic projection systems reflects the perceived statistics of the environment computed in frontal cortex. By normalizing dopamine levels, dopaminergic drugs might counteract the bias elicited by the perceived environment. 2019 Chemistry of the Adaptive Mind: Lessons from Dopamine. Neuron United States
31600508 The brain is worthy of study because it is in charge of behavior. A flurry of recent technical advances in measuring and quantifying naturalistic behaviors provide an important opportunity for advancing brain science. However, the problem of understanding unrestrained behavior in the context of neural recordings and manipulations remains unsolved, and developing approaches to addressing this challenge is critical. Here we discuss considerations in computational neuroethology-the science of quantifying naturalistic behaviors for understanding the brain-and propose strategies to evaluate progress. We point to open questions that require resolution and call upon the broader systems neuroscience community to further develop and leverage measures of naturalistic, unrestrained behavior, which will enable us to more effectively probe the richness and complexity of the brain. 2019 Computational Neuroethology: A Call to Action.

31600507 Scientific experimentation depends on the artificial control of natural phenomena. The inaccessibility of cognitive processes to direct manipulation can make such control difficult to realize. Here, we discuss approaches for overcoming this challenge. We advocate the incorporation of experimental techniques from sensory psychophysics into the study of cognitive processes such as decision making and executive control. These techniques include the use of simple parameterized stimuli to precisely manipulate available information and computational models to jointly quantify behavior and neural responses. We illustrate the potential for such techniques to drive theoretical development, and we examine important practical details of how to conduct controlled experiments when using them.

31587919 Hexanucleotide GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most prevalent genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). One pathogenic mechanism is the aberrant accumulation of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins produced by the unconventional translation of expanded RNA repeats. Here, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens for modifiers of DPR protein production in human cells. We found that DDX3X, an RNA helicase, suppresses the repeat-associated non-AUG translation of GGGGCC repeats. DDX3X directly binds to (GGGGCC)n RNAs but not antisense (CCCCGG)n RNAs. Its helicase activity is essential for the translation repression. Reduction of DDX3X increases DPR levels in C9ORF72-ALS/FTD patient cells and enhances (GGGGCC)n-mediated toxicity in Drosophila. Elevating DDX3X expression is sufficient to decrease DPR levels, rescue nucleocytoplasmic transport abnormalities, and improve survival of patient iPSC-differentiated neurons. This work identifies genetic modifiers of DPR protein production and provides potential therapeutic targets for C9ORF72-ALS/FTD. 2019 CRISPR-Cas9 Screens Identify the RNA Helicase DDX3X as a Repressor of C9ORF72 (GGGGCC)n Repeat-Associated Non-AUG Translation.

31587918 How do neurons in orofacial motor cortex (MCtx) orchestrate behaviors? We show that focal activation of MCtx corticobulbar neurons evokes behaviorally relevant concurrent movements of the forelimb, jaw, nose, and vibrissae. The projections from different locations in MCtx form gradients of boutons across premotor nuclei spinal trigeminal pars oralis (SpVO) and interpolaris rostralis (SpVIr). Furthermore, retrograde viral tracing from muscles that control orofacial actions shows that these premotor nuclei segregate their outputs. In the most dramatic case, both SpVO and SpVIr are premotor to forelimb and vibrissa muscles, while only SpVO is premotor to jaw muscles. Functional confirmation of the superimposed control by MCtx was obtained through selective optogenetic activation of corticobulbar neurons on the basis of their preferential projections to SpVO versus SpVIr. We conclude that neighboring projection neurons in orofacial MCtx form parallel pathways to distinct pools of trigeminal premotor neurons that coordinate motor actions into a behavior. 2019 Orofacial Movements Involve Parallel Corticobulbar Projections from Motor Cortex to Trigeminal Premotor Nuclei.

31585809 In humans, disruption of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. However, the mechanism by which deficient NMD leads to neurodevelopmental dysfunction remains unknown, preventing development of targeted therapies. Here we identified novel protein-coding UPF2 (UP-Frameshift 2) variants in humans with NDD, including speech and language deficits. In parallel, we found that mice lacking Upf2 in the forebrain (Upf2 fb-KO mice) show impaired NMD, memory deficits, abnormal long-term potentiation (LTP), and social and communication deficits. Surprisingly, Upf2 fb-KO mice exhibit elevated expression of immune genes and brain inflammation. More importantly, treatment with two FDA-approved anti-inflammatory drugs reduced brain inflammation, restored LTP and long-term memory, and reversed social and communication deficits. Collectively, our findings indicate that impaired UPF2-dependent NMD leads to neurodevelopmental dysfunction and suggest that anti-inflammatory agents may prove effective for treatment of disorders with impaired NMD. 2019 Inhibition of Upf2-Dependent Nonsense-Mediated Decay Leads to Behavioral and Neurophysiological Abnormalities by Activating the Immune Response.

31582313 The periaqueductal gray (PAG) in the midbrain is known to coordinate behavioral and autonomic responses to threat and injury through its descending projections to the brainstem. Here, we show that neurotensin (NTS)-expressing glutamatergic neurons in the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) powerfully promote non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep partly through their projection to the caudal medulla. Optogenetic and chemogenetic activation of vlPAG NTS neurons strongly enhanced NREM sleep, whereas their inactivation increased wakefulness. Calcium imaging and optrode recording showed that they are preferentially active during NREM sleep. The NREM-promoting effect of vlPAG NTS neurons is partly mediated by their projection to the caudal ventromedial medulla, where they excite GABAergic neurons. Bidirectional optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations showed that the medullary GABAergic neurons also promote NREM sleep, and they innervate multiple monoaminergic populations. Together, these findings reveal a novel pathway for NREM sleep generation, in which glutamatergic neurons drive broad GABAergic inhibition of wake-promoting neuronal populations. 2019 Control of Non-REM Sleep by Midbrain Neurotensinergic Neurons.

31564592 The fan-shaped body (FB) neuropil in the Drosophila brain central complex (CX) controls a variety of adult behaviors, including navigation and sleep. How neuronal processes are organized into precise layers and columns in the FB and how alterations in FB neural-circuit wiring affect animal behaviors are unknown. We report here that secreted semaphorin 2b (Sema-2b) acts through its transmembrane receptor Plexin B (PlexB) to locally attract neural processes to specific FB laminae. Aberrant Sema-2b/PlexB signaling leads to select disruptions in neural lamination, and these disruptions result in the formation of ectopic inhibitory connections between subsets of FB neurons. These structural alternations and connectivity defects are associated with changes in fly sleep and arousal, emphasizing the importance of lamination-mediated neural wiring in a central brain region critical for normal sleep behavior. 2019 Semaphorin 2b Regulates Sleep-Circuit Formation in the Drosophila Central Brain.

31563294 Effective sensory processing depends on sensory experience-dependent metaplasticity, which allows homeostatic maintenance of neural network activity and preserves feature selectivity. Following a strong increase in sensory drive, plasticity mechanisms that decrease the strength of excitatory synapses are preferentially engaged to maintain stability in neural networks. Such adaptation has been demonstrated in various model systems, including mouse primary visual cortex (V1), where excitatory synapses on layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons undergo rapid reduction in strength when visually deprived mice are reexposed to light. Here, we report that this form of plasticity is specific to intracortical inputs to V1 L2/3 neurons and depends on the activity of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and group I metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). Furthermore, we found that expression of the immediate early gene (IEG) Homer1a (H1a) and its subsequent interaction with mGluR5s are necessary for this input-specific metaplasticity. 2019 Input-Specific Metaplasticity in the Visual Cortex Requires Homer1a-Mediated mGluR5 Signaling.

31561919 Visual spatial perception in the mammalian brain occurs through two parallel pathways: one reaches the primary visual cortex (V1) through the thalamus and another the superior colliculus (SC) via direct projections from the retina. The origin, development, and relative function of these two evolutionarily distinct pathways remain obscure. We examined the early functional development of both pathways by simultaneously imaging pre- and post-synaptic spontaneous neuronal activity. We observed that the quality of retinal activity transfer to the thalamus and superior colliculus does not change across the first two postnatal weeks. However, beginning in the second postnatal week, retinal activity does not drive V1 as strongly as earlier wave activity, suggesting that intrinsic cortical activity competes with signals from the sensory periphery as the cortex matures. Together, these findings bring new insight into the function of the SC and V1 and the role of peripheral activity in driving both circuits across development. 2019 Visual Cortex Gains Independence from Peripheral Drive before Eye Opening.

31557462 Adult cortical areas consist of specialized cell types and circuits that support unique higher-order cognitive functions. How this regional diversity develops from an initially uniform neuroepithelium has been the subject of decades of seminal research, and emerging technologies, including single-cell transcriptomics, provide a new perspective on area-specific molecular diversity. Here, we review the early developmental processes that underlie cortical arealization, including both cortex intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms as embodied by the protomap and protocortex hypotheses, respectively. We propose an integrated model of serial homology whereby intrinsic genetic programs and local factors establish early transcriptomic differences between excitatory neurons destined to give rise to broad &quot;proto-regions,&quot; and activity-dependent mechanisms lead to progressive refinement and formation of sharp boundaries between functional areas. Finally, we explore the potential of these basic developmental processes to inform our understanding of the emergence of functional neural networks and circuit abnormalities in neurodevelopmental disorders. 2019 Development and Arealization of the Cerebral Cortex.

31557461 Despite enormous progress in machine learning, artificial neural networks still lag behind brains in their ability to generalize to new situations. Given identical training data, differences in generalization are caused by many defining features of a learning algorithm, such as network architecture and learning rule. Their joint effect, called &quot;inductive bias,&quot; determines how well any learning algorithm-or brain-generalizes: robust generalization needs good inductive biases. Artificial networks use rather nonspecific biases and often latch onto patterns that are only informative about the statistics of the training data but may not generalize to different scenarios. Brains, on the other hand, generalize across comparatively drastic changes in the sensory input all the time. We highlight some shortcomings of state-of-the-art learning algorithms compared to biological brains and discuss several ideas about how neuroscience can guide the quest for better inductive biases by providing useful constraints on representations and network architecture. 2019 Engineering a Less Artificial Intelligence.

31542321 Dysregulation of neuronal excitability underlies the pathogenesis of tauopathies, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with tau inclusions. A majority of FTD-causing tau mutations are located in the microtubule-binding domain, but how these mutations alter neuronal excitability is largely unknown. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing in human pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and isogenic controls, we show that the FTD-causing V337M tau mutation impairs activity-dependent plasticity of the cytoskeleton in the axon initial segment (AIS). Extracellular recordings by multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) revealed that the V337M tau mutation in human neurons leads to an abnormal increase in neuronal activity in response to chronic depolarization. Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy of human neurons with this mutation showed that AIS plasticity is impaired by the abnormal accumulation of end-binding protein 3 (EB3) in the AIS submembrane region. These findings expand our understanding of how FTD-causing tau mutations dysregulate components of the neuronal cytoskeleton, leading to network dysfunction. 2019 Pathogenic Tau Impairs Axon Initial Segment Plasticity and Excitability Homeostasis.

31540825 In humans, the extent to which body-based cues, such as vestibular, somatosensory, and motoric cues, are necessary for normal expression of spatial representations remains unclear. Recent breakthroughs in immersive virtual reality technology allowed us to test how body-based cues influence spatial representations of large-scale environments in humans. Specifically, we manipulated the availability of body-based cues during navigation using an omnidirectional treadmill and a head-mounted display, investigating brain differences in levels of activation (i.e., univariate analysis), patterns of activity (i.e., multivariate pattern analysis), and putative network interactions between spatial retrieval tasks using fMRI. Our behavioral and neuroimaging results support the idea that there is a core, modality-independent network supporting spatial memory retrieval in the human brain. Thus, for well-learned spatial environments, at least in humans, primarily visual input may be sufficient for expression of complex representations of spatial environments.

31537465 Sleep pressure increases during wake and dissipates during sleep, but the molecules and neurons that measure homeostatic sleep pressure remain poorly understood. We present a pharmacological assay in larval zebrafish that generates short-term increases in wakefulness followed by sustained rebound sleep after washout. The intensity of global neuronal activity during drug-induced wakefulness predicted the amount of subsequent rebound sleep. Whole-brain mapping with the neuronal activity marker phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) identified preoptic Galanin (Galn)-expressing neurons as selectively active during rebound sleep, and the relative induction of galn transcripts was predictive of total rebound sleep time. Galn is required for sleep homeostasis, as galn mutants almost completely lacked rebound sleep following both pharmacologically induced neuronal activity and physical sleep deprivation. These results suggest that Galn plays a key role in responding to sleep pressure signals derived from neuronal activity and functions as an output arm of the vertebrate sleep homeostat. 2019 The Neuropeptide Galanin Is Required for Homeostatic Rebound Sleep following Increased Neuronal Activity.

31522764 The integrated stress response (ISR) is activated in response to diverse stress stimuli to maintain homeostasis in neurons. Central to this process is the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α). Here, we report a critical role for ISR in regulating the mammalian circadian clock. The eIF2α kinase GCN2 rhythmically phosphorylates eIF2α in the suprachiasmatic circadian clock. Increased eIF2α phosphorylation shortens the circadian period in both fibroblasts and mice, whereas reduced eIF2α phosphorylation lengthens the circadian period and impairs circadian rhythmicity in animals. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of eIF2α promotes mRNA translation of Atf4. ATF4 binding motifs are identified in multiple clock genes, including Per2, Per3, Cry1, Cry2, and Clock. ATF4 binds to the TTGCAGCA motif in the Per2 promoter and activates its transcription. Together, these results demonstrate a significant role for ISR in circadian physiology and provide a potential link between dysregulated ISR and circadian dysfunction in brain diseases. 2019 The eIF2α Kinase GCN2 Modulates Period and Rhythmicity of the Circadian Clock by Translational Control of Atf4.

31521441 Long-range synchronization of neural oscillations correlates with distinct behaviors, yet its causal role remains unproven. In mice, tests of avoidance behavior evoke increases in theta-frequency (∼8 Hz) oscillatory synchrony between the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To test the causal role of this synchrony, we dynamically modulated vHPC-mPFC terminal activity using optogenetic stimulation. Oscillatory stimulation at 8 Hz maximally increased avoidance behavior compared to 2, 4, and 20 Hz. Moreover, avoidance behavior was selectively increased when 8-Hz stimulation was delivered in an oscillatory, but not pulsatile, manner. Furthermore, 8-Hz oscillatory stimulation enhanced vHPC-mPFC neurotransmission and entrained neural activity in the vHPC-mPFC network, resulting in increased synchrony between vHPC theta activity and mPFC spiking. These data suggest a privileged role for vHPC-mPFC theta-frequency communication in generating avoidance behavior and provide direct evidence that synchronized oscillations play a role in facilitating neural transmission and behavior. 2019 Hippocampal-Prefrontal Theta Transmission Regulates Avoidance Behavior.

31519460 All sensory information is encoded in neural spike trains. It is unknown how the brain utilizes this neural code to drive behavior. Here, we unravel the decoding rules of the brain at the most elementary level by linking behavioral decisions to retinal output signals in a single-photon detection task. A transgenic mouse line allowed us to separate the two primary retinal outputs, ON and OFF pathways, carrying information about photon absorptions as increases and decreases in spiking, respectively. We measured the sensitivity limit of rods and the most sensitive ON and OFF ganglion cells and correlated these results with visually guided behavior using markerless head and eye tracking. We show that behavior relies only on the ON pathway even when the OFF pathway would allow higher sensitivity. Paradoxically, behavior does not rely on the spike code with maximal information but instead relies on a decoding strategy based on increases in spiking. 2019 Paradoxical Rules of Spike Train Decoding Revealed at the Sensitivity Limit of Vision.

31515109 Mutations in one SETD5 allele are genetic causes of intellectual disability and autistic spectrum disorders. However, the mechanisms by which SETD5 regulates brain development and function remain largely elusive. Herein, we found that Setd5 haploinsufficiency impairs the proliferative dynamics of neural progenitors and synaptic wiring of neurons, ultimately resulting in behavioral deficits in mice. Mechanistically, Setd5 inactivation in neural stem cells, zebrafish, and mice equally affects genome-wide levels of H3K36me3 on active gene bodies. Notably, we demonstrated that SETD5 directly deposits H3K36me3, which is essential to allow on-time RNA elongation dynamics. Hence, Setd5 gene loss leads to abnormal transcription, with impaired RNA maturation causing detrimental effects on gene integrity and splicing. These findings identify SETD5 as a fundamental epigenetic enzyme controlling the transcriptional landscape in neural progenitors and their derivatives and illuminate the molecular events that connect epigenetic defects with neuronal dysfunctions at the basis of related human diseases. 2019 SETD5 Regulates Chromatin Methylation State and Preserves Global Transcriptional Fidelity during Brain Development and Neuronal Wiring.

31495646 Understanding how cortical inhibition shapes circuit function requires identifying the connectivity rules relating the response properties of inhibitory interneurons and their postsynaptic targets. Here we explore the orientation tuning of layer 2/3 inhibitory inputs in the ferret visual cortex using a combination of in vivo axon imaging, functional input mapping, and physiology. Inhibitory boutons exhibit robust orientation-tuned responses with preferences that can differ significantly from the cortical column in which they reside. Inhibitory input fields measured with patterned optogenetic stimulation and intracellular recordings revealed that these inputs originate from a wide range of orientation domains, inconsistent with a model of co-tuned inhibition and excitation. Intracellular synaptic conductance measurements confirm that individual neurons can depart from a co-tuned regime. Our results argue against a simple rule for the arrangement of inhibitory inputs supplied by layer 2/3 circuits and suggest that heterogeneity in presynaptic inhibitory networks contributes to neural response properties. 2019 Functional Logic of Layer 2/3 Inhibitory Connectivity in the Ferret Visual Cortex.

31495645 The classic approach to measure the spiking response of neurons involves the use of metal electrodes to record extracellular potentials. Starting over 60 years ago with a single recording site, this technology now extends to ever larger numbers and densities of sites. We argue, based on the mechanical and electrical properties of existing materials, estimates of signal-to-noise ratios, assumptions regarding extracellular space in the brain, and estimates of heat generation by the electronic interface, that it should be possible to fabricate rigid electrodes to concurrently record from essentially every neuron in the cortical mantle. This will involve fabrication with existing yet nontraditional materials and procedures. We further emphasize the need to advance materials for improved flexible electrodes as an essential advance to record from neurons in brainstem and spinal cord in moving animals. 2019 Can One Concurrently Record Electrical Spikes from Every Neuron in a Mammalian Brain?

Thousands of enhancers are also active in the developing retinae, many having features of cell- and developmental stage-specific activity. We studied dynamic changes in the 3D chromatin landscape important for precisely orchestrated changes in gene expression during retinal development by ultra-deep in situ Hi-C analysis on murine retinae. We identified developmental-stage-specific changes in chromatin compartments and enhancer-promoter interactions. We developed a machine learning-based algorithm to map euchromatin and heterochromatin domains genome-wide and overlaid it with chromatin compartments identified by Hi-C.

31492534 Transmembrane AMPA receptor (AMPAR) regulatory proteins (TARPs) modulate AMPAR synaptic trafficking and transmission via disc-large (DLG) subfamily of membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs). Despite extensive studies, the molecular mechanism governing specific TARP/MAGUK interaction remains elusive. Using stargazin and PSD-95 as the representatives, we discover that the entire tail of stargazin (Stg_CT) is required for binding to PSD-95. The PDZ binding motif (PBM) and an Arg-rich motif upstream of PBM conserved in TARPs bind to multiple sites on PSD-95, thus resulting in a highly specific and multivalent stargazin/PSD-95 complex. Stargazin in complex with PSD-95 or PSD-95-assembled postsynaptic complexes form highly concentrated and dynamic condensates via phase separation, reminiscent of stargazin/PSD-95-mediated AMPAR synaptic clustering and trapping. Importantly, charge neutralization mutations in TARP_CT Arg-rich motif weakened TARP's condensation with PSD-95 and impaired TARP-mediated AMPAR synaptic transmission in mice hippocampal neurons. The TARP_CT/PSD-95 interaction mode may have implications for understanding clustering of other synaptic transmembrane proteins. 2019 Phase Separation-Mediated TARP/MAGUK Complex Condensation and AMPA Receptor Synaptic Transmission.

Here, we present structures of the α3β4 nicotinic receptor in lipidic and detergent environments, using functional reconstitution to define lipids appropriate for structural analysis. The structures of the receptor in complex with nicotine, as well as the α3β4-selective ligand AT-1001, complemented by molecular dynamics, suggest principles of agonist selectivity. The structures further reveal much of the architecture of the intracellular domain, where mutagenesis experiments and simulations define residues governing ion conductance. 2019 Agonist Selectivity and Ion Permeation in the α3β4 Ganglionic Nicotinic Receptor.

31488328 Astrocytes are particularly promising candidates for reprogramming into neurons, as they maintain some of the original patterning information from their radial glial ancestors. However, to which extent the position of astrocytes influences the fate of reprogrammed neurons remains unknown. To elucidate this, we performed stab wound injury covering an entire neocortical column, including the gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), and targeted local reactive astrocytes via injecting FLEx switch (Cre-On) adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors into mGFAP-Cre mice. Single proneural factors were not sufficient for adequate reprogramming, although their combination with the nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (Nurr1) improved reprogramming efficiency. Nurr1 and Neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) resulted in high-efficiency reprogramming of targeted astrocytes into neurons that develop lamina-specific hallmarks, including the appropriate long-distance axonal projections. Surprisingly, in the WM, we did not observe any reprogrammed neurons, thereby unveiling a crucial role of region- and layer-specific differences in astrocyte reprogramming. 2019 Inducing Different Neuronal Subtypes from Astrocytes in the Injured Mouse Cerebral Cortex.

31487528 CNS infections continue to rise in incidence in conjunction with increases in immunocompromised populations or conditions that contribute to the emergence of pathogens, such as global travel, climate change, and human encroachment on animal territories. The severity and complexity of these diseases is impacted by the diversity of etiologic agents and their routes of neuroinvasion. In this review, we present historical, clinical, and molecular concepts regarding the mechanisms of pathogen invasion of the CNS. We also discuss the structural components of CNS compartments that influence pathogen entry and recent discoveries of the pathways exploited by pathogens to facilitate CNS infections. Advances in our understanding of the CNS invasion mechanisms of different neurotropic pathogens may enable the development of strategies to control their entry and deliver drugs to mitigate established infections. 2019 Mechanisms of Pathogen Invasion into the Central Nervous System.

31487527 The role of the thalamus in cortical sensory transmission is well known, but its broader role in cognition is less appreciated. Recent studies have shown thalamic engagement in dynamic regulation of cortical activity in attention, executive control, and perceptual decision-making, but the circuit mechanisms underlying such functionality are unknown. Because the thalamus is composed of excitatory neurons that are devoid of local recurrent excitatory connectivity, delineating long-range, input-output connectivity patterns of single thalamic neurons is critical for building functional models. We discuss this need in relation to existing organizational schemes such as core versus matrix and first-order versus higher-order relay nuclei. We propose that a new classification is needed based on thalamocortical motifs, where structure naturally informs function. Overall, our synthesis puts understanding thalamic organization at the forefront of existing research in systems and computational neuroscience, with both basic and translational applications. 2019 Thalamocortical Circuit Motifs: A General Framework.

31474508 The axon initial segment (AIS) is a unique neuronal compartment that plays a crucial role in the generation of action potential and neuronal polarity. The assembly of the AIS requires membrane, scaffolding, and cytoskeletal proteins, including Ankyrin-G and TRIM46. How these components cooperate in AIS formation is currently poorly understood. Here, we show that Ankyrin-G acts as a scaffold interacting with End-Binding (EB) proteins and membrane proteins such as Neurofascin-186 to recruit TRIM46-positive microtubules to the plasma membrane. Using in vitro reconstitution and cellular assays, we demonstrate that TRIM46 forms parallel microtubule bundles and stabilizes them by acting as a rescue factor. TRIM46-labeled microtubules drive retrograde transport of Neurofascin-186 to the proximal axon, where Ankyrin-G prevents its endocytosis, resulting in stable accumulation of Neurofascin-186 at the AIS. Neurofascin-186 enrichment in turn reinforces membrane anchoring of Ankyrin-G and subsequent recruitment of TRIM46-decorated microtubules. Our study reveals feedback-based mechanisms driving AIS assembly. 2019 Feedback-Driven Assembly of the Axon Initial Segment. Neuron United States

31471123 In pursuit of food, hungry animals mobilize significant energy resources and overcome exhaustion and fear. How need and motivation control the decision to continue or change behavior is not understood. Using a single fly treadmill, we show that hungry flies persistently track a food odor and increase their effort over repeated trials in the absence of reward suggesting that need dominates negative experience. We further show that odor tracking is regulated by two mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) connecting the MB to the lateral horn. These MBONs, together with dopaminergic neurons and Dop1R2 signaling, control behavioral persistence. Conversely, an octopaminergic neuron, VPM4, which directly innervates one of the MBONs, acts as a brake on odor tracking by connecting feeding and olfaction. Together, our data suggest a function for the MB in internal state-dependent expression of behavior that can be suppressed by external inputs conveying a competing behavioral drive. 2019 A Neural Circuit Arbitrates between Persistence and Withdrawal in Hungry Drosophila.

31466734 Neural computation involves diverse types of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons that are integrated with excitatory (E) neurons into precisely structured circuits. To understand how each neuron type shapes sensory representations, we measured firing patterns of defined types of neurons in the barrel cortex while mice performed an active, whisker-dependent object localization task. Touch excited fast-spiking (FS) interneurons at short latency, followed by activation of E neurons and somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons. Touch only weakly modulated vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing (VIP) interneurons. Voluntary whisker movement activated FS neurons in the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) target layers, a subset of SST neurons and a majority of VIP neurons. Together, FS neurons track thalamic input, mediating feedforward inhibition. SST neurons monitor local excitation, providing feedback inhibition. VIP neurons are activated by non-sensory inputs, disinhibiting E and FS neurons. Our data reveal rules of recruitment for interneuron types during behavior, providing foundations for understanding computation in cortical microcircuits. 2019 Recruitment of GABAergic Interneurons in the Barrel Cortex during Active Tactile Behavior.

31447169 Virtuosic motor performance requires the ability to evaluate and modify individual gestures within a complex motor sequence. Where and how the evaluative and premotor circuits operate within the brain to enable such temporally precise learning is poorly understood. Songbirds can learn to modify individual syllables within their complex vocal sequences, providing a system for elucidating the underlying evaluative and premotor circuits. We combined behavioral and optogenetic methods to identify 2 afferents to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that serve evaluative roles in syllable-specific learning and to establish that downstream cortico-basal ganglia circuits serve a learning role that is only premotor. Furthermore, song performance-contingent optogenetic stimulation of either VTA afferent was sufficient to drive syllable-specific learning, and these learning effects were of opposite valence. Finally, functional, anatomical, and molecular studies support the idea that these evaluative afferents bidirectionally modulate VTA dopamine neurons to enable temporally precise vocal learning. 2019 Discrete Evaluative and Premotor Circuits Enable Vocal Learning in Songbirds.

31439429 Recent studies reveal the occasional impact of single neurons on surround firing statistics and even simple behaviors. Exploiting the advantages of a simple cortex, we examined the influence of single pyramidal neurons on surrounding cortical circuits. Brief activation of single neurons triggered reliable sequences of firing in tens of other excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons, reflecting cascading activity through local networks, as indicated by delayed yet precisely timed polysynaptic subthreshold potentials. The evoked patterns were specific to the pyramidal cell of origin, extended over hundreds of micrometers from their source, and unfolded over up to 200 ms. Simultaneous activation of pyramidal cell pairs indicated balanced control of population activity, preventing paroxysmal amplification. Single cortical pyramidal neurons can thus trigger reliable postsynaptic activity that can propagate in a reliable fashion through cortex, generating rapidly evolving and non-random firing sequences reminiscent of those observed in mammalian hippocampus during &quot;replay&quot; and in avian song circuits. 2019 Reliable Sequential Activation of Neural Assemblies by Single Pyramidal Cells in a Three-Layered Cortex.

31437453 Spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP) is a leading cellular model for behavioral learning and memory with rich computational properties. However, the relationship between the millisecond-precision spike timing required for STDP and the much slower timescales of behavioral learning is not well understood. Neuromodulation offers an attractive mechanism to connect these different timescales, and there is now strong experimental evidence that STDP is under neuromodulatory control by acetylcholine, monoamines, and other signaling molecules. Here, we review neuromodulation of STDP, the underlying mechanisms, functional implications, and possible involvement in brain disorders. 2019 Neuromodulation of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity: Past, Present, and Future.
